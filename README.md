# 5G Quality of Service Analysis

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of 5G Quality of Service (QoS) focusing on network resource allocation and performance metrics. It includes data preprocessing, model training using linear regression and random forest regression, and visualization of the results. The insights drawn from this project aim to optimize network performance and enhance user experience in 5G networks.

## Project Overview
- **Objective:** To optimize network performance and enhance user experience in 5G networks through data-driven analysis.
- **Methods:** Used linear regression and random forest regression models to predict allocated bandwidth.
- **Visualizations:** Provided scatter plots and other visual aids to demonstrate the performance of the models.
